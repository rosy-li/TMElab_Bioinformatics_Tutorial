# TMElab_Bioinformatics_Tutorial
A tutorial of bioinformatics with R focusing on omics data analysis.

## Getting started with R
Unlike other low-level programming languages, R is not a programming languate developed for software engineering. Instead, it is a powerful tool for statistical analysis. To get started with the basic R syntaxa and getting falmiliar with RStudio interface, please attend this [free online class by Drs. Rafael Irizarry and Michael Love: Statistics and R](https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-and-r?index=product&queryID=a6d54c556f67fdc5b858183a7d084e6c&position=6&v=1&linked_from=autocomplete&c=autocomplete). 

The workload is ~4 hours/week, 4 weeks in total if you do not have any experiences in other programming languages.

After getting familiar with the basic R syntax, please attend [this class: High dimensional data analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/high-dimensional-data-analysis?index=product&queryID=251b830f062da842df3d1f724eec0f25&position=1&v=1&linked_from=autocomplete&c=autocomplete), which is a good practice for a higher level R programming.

## Getting started with Bioinformatics
Now, you should be familiar with the basic R syntax, plotting and statistical analysis. To utilize this powerful tool for statistical analysis, please check out [this class on Coursera: Bioinformatics: Introduction and Methods](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bioinformatics-pku)
