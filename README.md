# TMElab_Bioinformatics_Tutorial
A tutorial of bioinformatics with R focusing on omics data analysis.

## Getting started with R
Unlike other low-level programming languages, R is not a programming languate developed for software engineering. Instead, it is a powerful tool for statistical analysis. 

To get started with the basic R syntaxa and getting falmiliar with RStudio interface, please attend this [free online class by Drs. Rafael Irizarry and Michael Love: Statistics and R](https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-and-r?index=product&queryID=a6d54c556f67fdc5b858183a7d084e6c&position=6&v=1&linked_from=autocomplete&c=autocomplete). 

The workload is ~4 hours/week, 4 weeks in total if you do not have any experiences in other programming languages. Of course, you can complete this in one day if you wish. But I strongly suggest that you explore the software by yourself and play around with it for a couple of days so that you will be more confident in solving real-world questions. Make sure that you have > 20 hours in R coding before entering the next class.

After getting familiar with the basic R syntax, please attend [this class: High dimensional data analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/high-dimensional-data-analysis?index=product&queryID=251b830f062da842df3d1f724eec0f25&position=1&v=1&linked_from=autocomplete&c=autocomplete), which is a good practice for a higher level R programming.

The workload is ~6 hours/week, 4 weeks in total. But my experience is that you wil learn faster in this class and it shouldn't take >2 weeks to master it. Play aroud with the following packages:

• dplyr

• ggplot2 ([examples of cool visualizations with this package](https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html))

• stats

• gplots


## Getting started with Bioinformatic analysis
Now, you should be familiar with the basic R syntax, plotting and statistical analysis. To utilize this powerful tool for statistical analysis, please check out [this class on Coursera: Bioinformatics: Introduction and Methods](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bioinformatics-pku).

No need to go through every detail in this class. The purpose of this course is to let you get an idea of what bioinformatics does and what are the technologies associated to it. The workload is ~10 hours in total. 

Now, with the basic R programming techniques and the bioinformatic background, we will further strengthen our power by reviewing the statistical analysis tools and learning new ways to analyze the data. Statistical learning methods are widely used in omics data analysis. Therefore, please take this online class from Stanford to deepen your understand of statistics: [Statistical Learning by Dr. Trevor Hastie](https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-learning). And to apply statistical learning methods for real-world questions.

The workload is ~6 hours/week, 8 weeks.

Make sure that you are familiar with the following terms:

• Omics data anlaysis

• Quality control

• Data normalization, transformation and cleaning

• Differential expression analysis

• Data visualization (make sure you knwo how to generate different plots in R including histograms, scatter plots, volcano plots, heatmaps, network plots)

• Correlations, regressions, statistical tests (parametric and non-parametric tests, Student's t-test, ANOVA, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Cox regression, SVM, KNN, Lasso regression)

## Bulk transcriptomics data analysis
[The most comprehensive Next-Generation Sequencing tutorial](https://learn.gencore.bio.nyu.edu/) I found so far is from NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology. Please always refer to this tutorial if you have any questions. 

## RPPA data analysis

## Single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis
